      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I am a middle school math teacher at the Math and Science Success Academy. This is my 5th year teaching math, and I love it. </p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I was born and raised in Phoenix, AZ. I have not had the opportunity to live in another state, yet. </p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I enjoy all forms of storytelling. Whether that be reading a book or blog, watching a movie, or just catching up with friends. </p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>My dream job is teaching students how incorporate math and technology into marketable skills. </p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I have been living in Tucson for the past three years</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I want to be able to share what I learn in class with my students. My school is a Title One School. As such, we have an opportunity gap that needs to be closed. They deserve to have a strong STEM background before entering into college.</p>
